# Smart_SanitizationMonitoringApp

Coronavirus cases have hit the whole world, employers and employees alike are concerned about how the virus may spread through the workplace.
Serious respiratory illnesses are generally spread through coughing or sneezing, touching objects with contaminated hands, and touching your face after touching contaminated objects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Keeping the workplace clean and monitoring sanitization activities can inhibit the spread of communicable diseases. In addition to limiting exposure to the new strain of coronavirus—known as COVID-19—taking the following steps can help prevent the spread of the flu and other viruses.
Solution:
Regular Sanitization of workspaces is mandatory to maintain personnel safety in co-working spaces. It is very difficult to maintain a log of sanitization with personal supervision. In this project, we leverage the technology (IoT) to build a smart system to monitor the sanitization effectively at a low cost.

This is a flask web app which will record the time log, as well as cleaning staff details into the app as and when the sanitization preocedures have been completed. Data is recorded in the DynamoDb. 

App is hosted using Aws .
